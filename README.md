# SPFx Enterprise Product Skeleton

This repository defines the **canonical baseline** for building
enterprise-ready, tenant-agnostic, commercially sellable
SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part solutions.

## What This Repository Is
- A reference implementation
- A pattern library in code form
- A guardrail against tenant-specific or unsafe designs

## What This Repository Is Not
- A demo or sample web part
- A feature-complete solution
- An opinionated UX framework

## Design Principles
- Configuration over customization
- Tenant-agnostic by default
- Graceful degradation
- Explicit states (loading, empty, error)
- Versioned contracts

## How This Repo Is Used
- As a reference by the SPFx Agentic Factory
- As a baseline for new product repos
- As a comparison point for architectural decisions

Any deviation from patterns demonstrated here must be intentional and justified.
